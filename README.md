# Fake-News-SOURCE-Detector
Fake news refers to misinformation in the country which is spread through word of mouth and traditional media and more recently through digital forms of communication such as edited videos, memes, unverified advertisements and social media propagated rumours. Fake news spread through social media in the country has become a serious problem, with the potential of it resulting in mob violence, and hence it is necessary to stop the spread of such misinformation. 

Besides Fake News, the sources responsible for spreading Fake News are much more dangerous. Hence such sources must be detected and prevent spread of Fake News. Ultimately Eliminating the source could be very helpful in preventing spread of Fake News.

The dataset used in designing the machine learning model is a SELF-PREPARED DATASET. List of Fake and Real News along with their sources have been collected from ‘Inshorts’ - a mobile app that offers the latest news stories summarised in 60 words. The dataset consists of 58937 News Articles from over 900 sources including both Real and Fake News during the period 2016-18.

The documentation of the project is available in this Repository for Reference.
